.SH NAME
audiotest \- test audio device
.SH SYNOPSIS
.nf
\fBaudiotest\fR [\fB-2457\fR] [\fB-l\fR] [\fB-r\fR \fIrate\fR] [\fIdev\fR] ...
.fi

.SH DESCRIPTION
The \fBaudiotest\fR utility runs a test for the named audio device (or all
audio devices found on the system if none is given). The test includes playing
an audio sample over each channel and measuring the rate of playback for clock
drift.
.SH OPTIONS
The following options are supported:
.sp
.ne 2
.na
\fB-l\fR
.ad
.RS 6n
Loop mode. The test is run in an infinite loop.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.na
\fB-r\fR \fIrate\fR
.ad
.RS 6n
Sample rate. By default 48000Hz is used.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.na
\fB-2\fR
.ad
.RS 6n
Stereo (2-channel) mode. This is the default mode. Playback assumes 2 channels
are present.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.na
\fB-4\fR
.ad
.RS 6n
Quadraphonic mode (4-channel surround). The test assumes that four surround
channels are present.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.na
\fB-5\fR
.ad
.RS 6n
Surround sound mode (5.1). The test checks the left, right, surround left,
surround right, and center channels. The low frequency effects channel is not
tested.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.na
\fB-7\fR
.ad
.RS 6n
Surround sound mode (7.1). The test checks the left, right, surround left,
surround right, back surround left, back surround right, and center channels.
The low frequency effects channel is not tested.
.RE

.sp
.LP
If multiple modes are specified, the last one specified is used.

.SH OPERANDS
.ne 2
.na
\fIdev\fR
.ad
.RS 7n
The path to the device to test, for example, \fB/dev/dsp0\fR.
.RE

.SH SEE ALSO
\fBaudioconvert\fR(1), \fBaudiorecord\fR(1),
\fBaudio\fR(7I)
.SH BUGS
\fBaudiotest\fR has no way to detect the number of actual audio channels
supported by the physical device.
.sp
.LP
\fBaudiotest\fR does not test the low-frequency effects (LFE) channel.
.sp
.LP
There is no test for audio capture, volume controls, or other advanced device
features.
