.TH SSH-SOCKS5-PROXY-CONNECT 1 "Oct 30, 2002"
.SH NAME
ssh-socks5-proxy-connect \- Secure Shell proxy for SOCKS5
.SH SYNOPSIS
.LP
.nf
\fB/usr/lib/ssh/ssh-socks5-proxy-connect\fR
     [\fB-h\fR \fIsocks5_proxy_host\fR]
     [\fB-p\fR \fIsocks5_proxy_port\fR] \fIconnect_host\fR \fIconnect_port\fR

.SH DESCRIPTION
.LP
A proxy command for \fBssh\fR(1) that uses SOCKS5 (RFC 1928). Typical use is
where connections external to a network are only allowed via a socks gateway
server.
.sp
.LP
This proxy command does not provide any of the SOCKS5 authentication mechanisms
defined in RFC 1928. Only anonymous connections are possible.
.SH OPTIONS

The following options are supported:
.sp
.ne 2
.na
\fB\fB-h\fR \fIsocks5_proxy_host\fR\fR
.ad
.RS 24n
Specifies the proxy web server through which to connect. Overrides the
\fBSOCKS5_SERVER\fR environment variable.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.na
\fB\fB-p\fR \fIsocks5_proxy_port\fR\fR
.ad
.RS 24n
Specifies the port on which the proxy web server runs. If not specified, port
80 is assumed. Overrides the \fBSOCKS5_PORT\fR environment variable.
.RE

.SH OPERANDS
.LP
The following operands are supported:
.sp
.ne 2

.SH EXAMPLES
.LP
The recommended way to use a proxy connection command is to configure the
\fBProxyCommand\fR in \fBssh_config\fR(4) (see Example 1 and Example 2).
Example 3 shows how the proxy command can be specified on the command line when
running \fBssh\fR(1).
.LP
\fBExample 1 \fRSetting the proxy from the environment
.sp
.LP
The following example uses \fBssh-socks5-proxy-connect\fR in
\fBssh_config\fR(4) when the proxy is set from the environment:

.sp
.in +2
.nf
\fBHost playtime.foo.com
    ProxyCommand /usr/lib/ssh/ssh-socks5-proxy-connect \e
        playtime.foo.com 22\fR
.fi
.in -2
.sp

.LP
\fBExample 2 \fROverriding proxy environment variables
.sp
.LP
The following example uses \fBssh-socks5-proxy-connect\fR in
\fBssh_config\fR(4) to override (or if not set) proxy environment variables:

.sp
.in +2
.nf
\fBHost playtime.foo.com
    ProxyCommand /usr/lib/ssh/ssh-socks5-proxy-connect -h socks-gw \e
        -p 1080 playtime.foo.com 22\fR
.fi
.in -2
.sp

.LP
\fBExample 3 \fRUsing the command line
.sp
.LP
The following example uses \fBssh-socks5-proxy-connect\fR from the \fBssh\fR(1)
command line:

.sp
.in +2
.nf
example$ \fBssh -o'ProxyCommand=/usr/lib/ssh/ssh-socks5-proxy-connect \e
    -h socks-gw -p 1080 playtime.foo.com 22' playtime.foo.com\fR
.fi
.in -2
.sp

.sp
.ne 2
.na
\fB\fBSOCKS5_PORT\fR\fR
.ad
.RS 17n

.RE

.SH EXIT STATUS
.LP
The following exit values are returned:
.sp
.ne 2
