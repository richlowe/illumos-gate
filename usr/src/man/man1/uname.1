.SH NAME
uname \- print name of current system
.SH SYNOPSIS
.LP
.nf
\fBuname\fR [\fB-aimnprsvX\fR]
.fi

.LP
.nf
\fBuname\fR [\fB-S\fR \fIsystem_name\fR]
.fi

.SH DESCRIPTION
.LP
The \fBuname\fR utility prints information about the current system on the
standard output. When options are specified, symbols representing one or more
system characteristics will be written to the standard output. If no options
are specified, \fBuname\fR prints the current operating system's name. The
options print selected information returned by \fBuname\fR(2),
\fBsysinfo\fR(2), or both.
.SH OPTIONS
.LP
The following options are supported:
.sp
.ne 2
.na
\fB\fB-a\fR\fR
.ad
.RS 18n
Prints basic information currently available from the system.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.na
\fB\fB-i\fR\fR
.ad
.RS 18n
Prints the name of the platform.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.na
\fB\fB-m\fR\fR
.ad
.RS 18n
Prints the machine hardware name (class). Use of this option is discouraged.
Use \fBuname\fR \fB-p\fR instead. See NOTES section below.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.na
\fB\fB-n\fR\fR
.ad
.RS 18n
Prints the nodename (the nodename is the name by which the system is known to a
communications network).
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.na
\fB\fB-p\fR\fR
.ad
.RS 18n
Prints the current host's \fBISA\fR or processor type.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.na
\fB\fB-r\fR\fR
.ad
.RS 18n
Prints the operating system release level.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.na
\fB\fB-s\fR\fR
.ad
.RS 18n
Prints the name of the operating system. This is the default.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.na
\fB\fB-S\fR \fIsystem_name\fR\fR
.ad
.RS 18n
The nodename may be changed by specifying a system name argument. The system
name argument is restricted to \fBSYS_NMLN\fR characters. \fBSYS_NMLN\fR is an
implementation specific value defined in \fB<sys/utsname.h>\fR\&. Only the
super-user is allowed this capability. This change does not persist across
reboots of the system. Use \fBsys-unconfig\fR(1M) to change a host's name
permanently.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.na
\fB\fB-v\fR\fR
.ad
.RS 18n
Prints the operating system version.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2

\fB\fB-X\fR \fR
.ad
.RS 18n
Prints expanded system information, one information element per line, as
expected by SCO UNIX. The displayed information includes:
.RS +4
.TP
.ie t \(bu
.el o
system name, node, release, version, machine, and number of CPUs.
.RE

.SH NOTES
.LP
Independent software vendors (\fBISV\fRs) and others who need to determine
detailed characteristics of the platform on which their software is either
being installed or executed should use the \fBuname\fR command.
.sp
.LP
To determine the operating system name and release level, use \fBuname
\fR\fB-sr\fR. To determine only the operating system release level, use
\fBuname \fR\fB-r\fR. Notice that operating system release levels are not
guaranteed to be in \fIx.y\fR format (such as 5.3, 5.4, 5.5, and so forth);
future releases could be in the \fIx.y.z\fR format (such as 5.3.1, 5.3.2,
5.4.1, and so forth).
.sp
.LP
In SunOS 4.\fIx\fR releases, the \fBarch\fR(1) command was often used to obtain
information similar to that obtained by using the \fBuname\fR command. The
\fBarch\fR(1) command output "sun4" was often incorrectly interpreted to
signify a SunOS SPARC system. If hardware platform information is desired, use
\fBuname \fR\fB-sp\fR.
.sp
.LP
The \fBarch\fR \fB-k\fR and \fBuname\fR \fB-m\fR commands return equivalent
values; however, the use of either of these commands by third party programs is
discouraged, as is the use of the \fBarch\fR command in general. To determine
the machine's Instruction Set Architecture (\fBISA\fR or processor type), use
\fBuname\fR with the \fB-p\fR option.
