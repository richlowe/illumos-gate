fcoei@port,0
.fi
.in -2

.SH DESCRIPTION
The \fBfcoei\fR driver is a pseudo device driver which encapsulates the raw
Fibre Channel frames into FCoE ethernet frames, or decapsulates FC frames from
FCoE ethernet frames. The supported FC frames include extended/basic link
services, common transport frames and initiator mode FCP frames.
.sp
.LP
The \fBfcoei\fR driver interfaces with the Sun Fibre Channel port driver,
\fBfp\fR(7D), and the FCoE transport driver, \fBfcoe\fR(7D).
