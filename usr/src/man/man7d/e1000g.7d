.Sh NAME
.Nm e1000g
.Nd Intel 1 Gigabit Client Ethernet Controller
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Pa /dev/net/e1000g*
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
driver is a GLDv3 NIC driver for Intel 1 Gigabit Ethernet devices which
are often found as discrete PCI and PCI expresss add-on-cards and built
into many Intel chipsets and platforms.
.Pp
On most models, the device driver supports transmit and receive
checksumming, 9000 byte jumbo frames, large send offload
.Pq LSO ,
LED control and Ethernet Pause frames.
.Pp
For each device supported by the
.Nm
driver, a character special-file will be created for each instance.
The first instance would have id 0 and would be named
.Sy e1000g0
and found in the file system at
.Pa /dev/net/e1000g0 .
This device node supports the Data Link Provider Interface
.Pq DLPI
which is documented in
.Xr dlpi 7P .
.Xr libdlpi 3LIB
provides a more usable interface on top of that.
.Pp
For administrative control, the device can be manipulated through the
.Xr dladm 1M
utility.
.Pp

.Sh CONFIGURATION
The
.Pa e1000g.conf
file contains some user configurable parameters, the format of which
is documented in
.Xr driver.conf 4 .
Generally, the use of
.Xr dladm 1M
is recommended over editing the configuration file.
