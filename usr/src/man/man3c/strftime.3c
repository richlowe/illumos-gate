.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
.LP
The \fBstrftime()\fR, \fBascftime()\fR, and \fBcftime()\fR functions place
bytes into the array pointed to by \fIs\fR as controlled by the string pointed
to by \fIformat\fR. The \fIformat\fR string consists of zero or more conversion
specifications and ordinary characters.  A conversion specification consists of
a '\fB%\fR' (percent) character and one or two terminating conversion
characters that determine the conversion specification's behavior.  All
ordinary characters (including the terminating null byte) are copied unchanged
into the array pointed to by \fIs\fR. If copying takes place between objects
that overlap, the behavior is undefined. For \fBstrftime()\fR, no more than
\fImaxsize\fR bytes are placed into the array.
.sp
.LP
If \fIformat\fR is \fB(char *)0\fR, then the locale's default format is used.
For \fBstrftime()\fR the default format is the same as \fB%c\fR; for
\fBcftime()\fR and \fBascftime()\fR the default format is the same as \fB%C\fR.
\fBcftime()\fR and \fBascftime()\fR first try to use the value of the
environment variable \fBCFTIME\fR, and if that is undefined or empty, the
default format is used.
.sp
.LP
Each conversion specification is replaced by appropriate characters as
described in the following list. The appropriate characters are determined by
the \fBLC_TIME\fR category of the program's locale and by the values contained
in the structure pointed to by \fItimeptr\fR for \fBstrftime()\fR and
\fBascftime()\fR, and by the time represented by \fIclock\fR for
\fBcftime()\fR.

The difference between \fB%U\fR and \fB%W\fR (and also between modified
conversion specifications \fB%OU\fR and \fB%OW\fR) lies in which day is counted
as the first of the week. Week number 1 is the first week in January starting

those days before the first Sunday or Monday in January for \fB%U\fR and
\fB%W\fR, respectively.

.LP
Some conversion specifications can be modified by the \fBE\fR and \fBO\fR
modifiers to indicate that an alternate format or specification should be used

the behavior will be as if the unmodified specification were used.

of \fBstrftime()\fR, \fBcftime()\fR, or \fBascftime()\fR be in a specific

.SH NOTES
.sp
.LP
The conversion specification for \fB%V\fR was changed in the Solaris 7 release.
This change was based on the public review draft of the ISO C9x standard at
that time. Previously, the specification stated that if the week containing 1
January had fewer than four days in the new year, it became week 53 of the
previous year. The ISO C9x standard committee subsequently recognized that that
specification had been incorrect.
.sp
.LP
The conversion specifications for \fB%g\fR, \fB%G\fR, \fB%Eg\fR, \fB%EG\fR, and
\fB%Og\fR were added in the Solaris 7 release.  This change was based on the
public review draft of the ISO C9x standard at that time. These specifications
are evolving.  If the ISO C9x standard is finalized with a different
conclusion, these specifications will change to conform to the ISO C9x standard
decision.

The conversion specification for \fB%u\fR was changed in the Solaris 8 release.
