.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Fn pthread_rwlock_clockwdlock ,
.Fn pthread_rwlock_timerwdlock ,
.Fn pthread_rwlock_relclockwdlock_np ,
and
.Fn pthread_rwlock_reltimewrdlock_np
functions apply a read lock to the read-write lock referenced by
.Fa rwlock .
The calling thread will acquire a write lock if there are no readers or
writers holding the lock, or pending writers.
However, if the read-write lock
.Fa rwlock
is not available, the calling thread will be suspended and wait for the
lock to become avaialble.
If the lock does not become available within a specified timeout, then
the function call will terminate without acquiring the lock and return
the
.Er ETIMEDOUT
error.
These functions all differ in terms of how the timeout is specified and
the clock that is used to determine when the timeout has elapsed.
.Pp
In general, the system provides the ability to program timeouts against
either the realtime clock,
.Dv CLOCK_REALTIME ,
which measure, the wall clock and is subject to changes due to time
synchronization daemons such as NTP and PTP, or the high-resolution clock,
.Dv CLOCK_HIGHRES ,
which is a non-adjustable high-resolution clock that is provided by
system hardware.
The specified timeout may either be specified as an absolute time in the
future or as a relative amount of time that should elapse.
Each clock has its own resolution, which can be determined by
.Xr clock_getres 3C .
Timeouts may be rounded up to a given clock's resolution.
Due to scheduling effects, it is possible that more time may elapse than
was specified in the timeout when the caller does not successfully
acquire the lock.
The
.Fn pthread_rwlock_clockwrlock
and
.Fn pthread_rwlock_relclockwrlock_np
functions allow the clock source to be used to be specified by the
.Fa clock
argument.
While there are additional clocks in the system, only
.Dv CLOCK_REALTIME
or
.Dv CLOCK_HIGHRES
may be specified.
The thread and process-specific CPU time clocks cannot be used.
Conversely, the
.Fn pthread_rwlock_timedwrlock
and
.Fn pthread_rwlock_reltimedwrlock_np
functions will always utilize the realtime clock,
.Dv CLOCK_REALTIME .
.Pp
The
.Fn pthread_rwlock_clockwrlock
and
.Fn pthread_rwlock_timedwrlock
functions treat the timeout value,
.Fa abstime ,
as the absolute time in the future when the timeout should expire.
Conversely, the
.Fn pthread_rwlock_relclockwrlock_np
and
.Fn pthread_rwlock_reltimedwrlock_np
functions operate in terms of a relative time.
The timer will expire when a specified amount of time passes on the
clock specified as indicated by
.Fa reltime .
If the read-write lock,
.Fa rwlock ,
can be immediately write-locked, then the timeout value is ignored
entirely, Even if the timeout had already expired or represented a
value that didn't make sense.
Both are only checked if the thread would block on the read-write lock
itself.
.Pp
Similarly, if a signal that causes a signal handler to be executed is
delivered to a thread blocked on a read-write lock, then upon return
from the signal handler, the thread resumes waiting for the lock as
though it was not interrupted.
.Pp
It is illegal for a thread to acquire a write lock on the same read-write
lock that it already holds either a read or write lock on.
.Sh RETURN VALUES
Upon successful completion, the
.Fn pthread_rwlock_clockwrlock ,
.Fn pthread_rwlock_timerwrlock ,
.Fn pthread_rwlock_relclockwrlock_np ,
and
.Fn pthread_rwlock_reltimerwrlock_np
return
.Sy 0
and have successfully acquired a write lock on
.Fa rwlock .
Otherwise, an error number is returned to indicate the error.
.Sh ERRORS
The
.Fn pthread_rwlock_clockwrlock ,
.Fn pthread_rwlock_timerwrlock ,
.Fn pthread_rwlock_relclockwrlock_np ,
and
.Fn pthread_rwlock_reltimerwrlock_np
will fail if:
.Bl -tag -width Er
.It Er EDEADLK
The calling thread already has a read or write lock on
.Fa rwlock
.It Er EINVAL
The value specified by
.Fa rwlock
does not refer to an initialized read-write
lock object.
The timeout nanosecond value is less than zero or greater than
or equal to 1,000 million.
.Pp
For
.Fn pthread_rwlock_clockwrlock
and
.Fn pthread_rwlock_relclockwrlock_np
the value of
.Fa clock
is either unsupported for locking or unknown to the system.
.It Er ETIMEDOUT
The lock could not be acquired before the specified timeout expired.
