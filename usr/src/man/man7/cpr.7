.Sh NAME
.Nm cpr
.Nd Suspend and resume module
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Pa /platform/i86pc/kernel/misc/amd64/cpr
.Pa /platform/sun4u/kernel/misc/sparcv9/cpr
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
module is a loadable module used to suspend and resume the entire system.
You may wish to suspend a system to save power or to power off
temporarily for transport.
The
.Nm
module should not be used in place of
a normal shutdown when performing any hardware reconfiguration or replacement.
In order for the resume operation to succeed, it is important that the hardware
configuration remain the same.
When the system is suspended, the entire system
state is preserved in non-volatile storage until a resume operation is
conducted.
.Pp
.Xr pmconfig 1M
and
.Xr power.conf 4
are used to configure the suspend-resume feature.
.Pp
The speed of suspend and resume operations can range from 15 seconds to
several minutes, depending on the system speed, memory size, and load.
.Pp
During resume operation, the
.Dv SIGTHAW
signal is sent to all processes to
allow them to do any special processing in response to suspend-resume
operation.
Normally applications are not required to do any special processing
because of suspend-resume, but some specialized processes can use
.Dv SIGTHAW
to restore the state prior to suspend.
For example,
.Sy X
can refresh the screen in response to
.Dv SIGTHAW .
.Pp
In some cases the
.Nm
module may be unable to perform the suspend operation.
If a system contains additional devices outside the standard shipped
configuration, it is possible that device drivers for these additional devices
might not support suspend-resume operations.
In this case, the suspend fails and an error message is displayed.
These devices must be removed or their
device drivers unloaded for the suspend operation to succeed.
Contact the
device manufacturer to obtain a new version of device driver that supports
suspend-resume.
.Pp
A suspend may also fail when devices or processes are performing critical or
time-sensitive operations (such as realtime operations).
The system will remain in its current running state.
Messages reporting the failure will be displayed
on the console and status returned to the caller.
Once the system is
successfully suspended the resume operation will succeed, barring external
influences such as a hardware reconfiguration.
.Pp
Some network-based applications may fail across a suspend and resume cycle.
This largely depends on the underlying network protocol and the applications
involved.
In general, applications that retry and automatically reestablish
connections will continue to operate transparently on a resume operation;
those applications that do not will likely fail.

.Sh NOTES
Certain device operations such as tape and floppy disk activities are not
resumable due to the nature of removable media.
These activities are detected
at suspend time, and must be stopped before the suspend operation will
complete successfully.
.Pp
Suspend-resume is currently supported only on a limited set of hardware
platforms.
