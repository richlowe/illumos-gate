.SH DESCRIPTION
.LP
The \fBbootadm\fR command manages the boot archive and, with x86 boot
environments, the GRUB (GRand Unified Bootloader) menu. The
\fBupdate-archive\fR option provides a way for user to update the boot archive
as a preventative measure or as part of a recovery procedure. The
\fBset-menu\fR subcommand allows you to switch the \fBauto-boot\fR timeout and
default boot entry in the GRUB menu.
.sp
.LP
The \fBinstall-bootloader\fR subcommand installs the system boot loader on a
ZFS pool. If ZFS pool was not specified with the \fB-P\fR option, then the boot
loader is installed on the ZFS pool that the system booted from. If the
system did not boot from a ZFS pool (for example, it booted an installer via PXE
or CD-ROM) then the \fB-P\fR option is required.
.sp
This subcommand can be used to install, update, and repair the boot loader on a
ZFS pool intended for booting. When disks in the ZFS pool used for booting the
system have been replaced, one should run \fBbootadm install-bootloader\fR to
ensure that all disks in that pool have the system boot loader installed.
.sp
.LP
The \fBlist-menu\fR subcommand displays the location of the GRUB menu and the
current GRUB menu entries. While the typical location of the GRUB menu is
\fB/boot/grub/menu.lst\fR, depending on the install method used the active GRUB
menu might be located somewhere else. Use the \fBlist-menu\fR subcommand to
locate the active GRUB menu. See the EXAMPLES section for typical output from
the \fBlist-menu\fR option.
.sp
.LP
Note that OpenBoot PROM (OBP)-based machines, such as SPARC systems, do not use
GRUB and have no boot menu manageable by \fBbootadm\fR.
.sp
.LP
The \fBbootadm\fR command determines dynamically the options supported by the
image to be managed, so that \fBbootadm\fR invoked on one platform can be used
to manage diskless clients of a different platform type.
.SH SUBCOMMANDS
.LP
The \fBbootadm\fR command has the following subcommands:
.sp
.ne 2
.na
\fB\fBupdate-archive\fR\fR
.ad
.sp .6
.RS 4n
Updates current boot archive if required. Applies to both SPARC and x86
platforms.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.na
\fB\fBlist-archive\fR\fR
.ad
.sp .6
.RS 4n
Lists the files and directories to be included in the boot archive. Applies to
both SPARC and x86 platforms.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.na
\fB\fBinstall-bootloader\fR\fR
.ad
.sp .6
.RS 4n
Applies platform specific method to install the system boot loader to the disks
that are part of the selected ZFS pool (either specified with \fB-P\fR or
the default).
.sp
On SPARC, the boot loader is installed in the boot area of the disk partition
used by the ZFS pool.
.sp
On x86, disks are formatted using either \fBMBR Partitioning\fR (Master Boot
Record) or using \fBGPT Partitioning\fR (GUID Partition Tables). The first
sector on the disk that is used by the \fBBIOS\fR to find a boot loader
is referred to as the \fBMBR\fR (Master Boot Record) and is always used
regardless of the partition scheme.
.sp
On x86, disks in a ZFS pool may be a combination of either type of partitioning
scheme.  If an entire disk was added to a ZFS pool (e.g. c0t0d0), then it was
formatted with \fBGPT\fR partitioning and the fact is recorded. The
\fBinstall-bootloader\fR subcommand will always update the system boot loader on
the disks. However, unless the entire disk was given a ZFS pool or the \fB-M\fR
option is specified, the \fBMBR\fR of the disk will not updated, as the system
cannot guarantee that the \fBMBR\fR belongs to it. If, for example, the system
was being dual booted, a different initial boot loader may be installed there.
.sp
When \fBGRUB\fR is being used as the system boot loader (currently on x86), to
reinstall the boot loader on some or all of the disks, the \fB-f\fR option must
be passed to the \fBinstall-bootloader\fR subcommand.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.na
\fB\fBset-menu\fR\fR
.ad
.sp .6
.RS 4n
Maintain the GRUB menu. The current GRUB menu is \fBboot/grub/menu.lst\fR,
relative to root. Do not depend on this location, because it is subject to
change. Applies to x86 platforms only.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.na
\fB\fBlist-menu\fR\fR
.ad
.sp .6
.RS 4n
Lists the location of the active GRUB menu, as well as the current GRUB menu
entries. This includes the autoboot-timeout, the default entry number, and the
title of each entry. Applies to x86 platforms only.
.RE

.SH OPTIONS
.LP
The \fBbootadm\fR command has the following options:
.sp
.ne 2
.na
\fB\fB-f\fR\fR
.ad
.sp .6
.RS 4n
In an \fBinstall-bootloader\fR operation, override boot loader versioning
constraints.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.na

.sp .6
.RS 4n
In an \fBupdate-archive\fR operation, archive content is checked but not
updated.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.na
\fB\fB-p\fR \fIplatform\fR\fR
.ad
.sp .6
.RS 4n
The platform, or machine hardware class, of the client. The platform type can
only be specified together with \fB-R\fR, and is generally useful only for
managing a diskless client where the client is of a different platform class
than the server. Platform must be one of \fBi86pc\fR, \fBsun4u\fR, or
\fBsun4v\fR.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.na
\fB\fB-v\fR\fR
.ad
.sp .6
.RS 4n
In an \fBupdate-archive\fR operation, stale files are displayed on stderr.
.sp
In an \fBinstall-bootloader\fR operation, display any output from tasks
performed.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.na
\fB\fB-M\fR\fR
.ad
.sp .6
.RS 4n
On x86 systems, in an \fBinstall-bootloader\fR operation, additionally installs
the system boot loader to the \fBMBR\fR (master boot record). For more
information, see the discussion of \fBinstall-bootloader\fR in the
\fBSUBCOMMANDS\fR section.
.sp
This option is not supported on non-x86 systems, and it is an error to specify
it.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.na
\fB-P\fR\ \fIpool\fR
.ad
.sp .6
.RS 4n
In an \fBinstall-bootloader\fR operation, the boot loader is installed on
the disks in the ZFS pool \fIpool\fR. If the \fB-P\fR option is not specified,
then the boot loader is installed on the ZFS pool that the system booted from.
If the system did not boot from a ZFS pool then the \fB-P\fR option is required.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.na
\fB\fB-R\fR\ \fIaltroot\fR\fR
.ad
.sp .6
.RS 4n
Operation is applied to an alternate root path. In an \fBinstall-bootloader\fR
operation, the boot loader is still installed on the specified pool; however,
the boot loader itself will come from the alternate root.
.LP
Note -
.sp
.RS 2
The root file system of any non-global zones must not be referenced with the
\fB-R\fR option. Doing so might damage the global zone's file system, might
compromise the security of the global zone, and might damage the non-global
zone's file system. See \fBzones\fR(5).
