Unlike any other single byte code pages or codesets, the MSFT CP864
has a mapping between ASCII range character 0x25 and U+066A. Due to
that, the u*_to_cp864.tbl mapping tables should have mappings for
that mapping manually after the automatic generation of the above.

There will be inevitable mappings from U+0025 to 0x25 of CP864 by the way.
