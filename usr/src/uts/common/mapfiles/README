Kernel Module Build Time Symbol Verification
--------------------------------------------

Historically, kernel modules have all been built as relocatable objects.
They are not dynamic objects and dependency information is always noted
in individual makefiles. Along with this, there has never been any
verification of the symbols that are being used. This means that it's
possible for a kernel module author to refer to a symbol that doesn't
exist and not find out until they try to install the module.

To help find these problems at build time, we provide an opt-in system
for modules to use, leveraging the link-editor's '-z defs' option.  This
option ensures that there are no unknown definitons at link-edit time.
To supply these definitions we supply a series of mapfiles in this
directory.

These mapfiles are not the traditional versioning mapfiles like those in
usr/src/lib/README.mapfiles! Please review the following differences
closely:

* These mapfiles do not declare any versions!
* These mapfiles do not use the 'SYMBOL_VERSION' directive, instead they
  use the 'SYMBOL_SCOPE' directive.
* These mapfiles do not hide symbols! Library mapfiles always have
  something to catch all local symbols. That should *never* be used
  here. These mapfiles should not affect visibility.
* All symbols in these mapfiles should be marked 'EXTERN' to indicate
  that they are not provided by the kernel module but by another.
* These mapfiles do not declare what is or isn't a public interface,
  though they are often grouped around interfaces, to make it easier for
  a driver author to get this right.

Mapfiles are organized based on kernel module. For example the GLDv3
device driver interface is provided by the 'mac' module and thus is
found in the file 'mac.mapfile'. The DDI is currently in the 'ddi'
mapfile. Functions that are found in genunix and unix that aren't in
the DDI should not be put in that mapfile.

Note, the existing files may not be complete. These are intended to only
have the public interfaces provided by modules and thus should not
include every symbol in them. As the need arises, add new symbols or
modules as appropriate.

To opt a module into this, first declare a series of MAPFILES that they
should check against in the module. This should be a series of one or
more files, for example:

MAPFILES += ddi mac

Next, you should add an include of Makefile.mapfile right before you
include Makefile.targ. You can do this with the following line:

include $(UTSBASE)/Makefile.mapfile
