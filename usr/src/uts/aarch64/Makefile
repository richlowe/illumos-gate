# Prerequisites
#
# The uts/Makefile defines build parallelism for AArch64 platforms such that
# armv8, and aarch64 are all built in parallel. This requires building
# certain parts before the parallel build can start. The uts/Makefile appends
# the '.prereq' string to the original target and executes this Makefile to
# build any prerequisites needed before the full parallel build can
# start. After that make continues with normal targets.
#
# Any build prerequisites for AArch64 builds should be described here.
#
# genassym is used to build aarch64/dtrace and genunix, so it should be built
# first.
#
# priv_const.c is required to build genunix.
#
# genunix is used by everyone to ctf-merge with. Genunix is CTF-merged with
#   intel/ip so as a side effect this dependency builds intel/ip as part of the
#   prerequisites.
