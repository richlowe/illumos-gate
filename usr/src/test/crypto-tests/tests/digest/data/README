These files are comprised of the NIST Test Vectors.

The SHA* vectors are taken directly from:
https://csrc.nist.gov/Projects/Cryptographic-Algorithm-Validation-Program/Secure-Hashing

The MD5 vectors are taken from:
https://s3.amazonaws.com/docs.nsrl.nist.gov/legacy/NSRLvectors.zip

Given that the initial format of the MD5 vectors is different than the SHA data,
the included convert.awk script was used to transform them into so the same
parser could be used for all the data.
