# The goal of this test suite is to test certain aspects of core dump
# generation and different core contents being specified. The
# 'dumper.32' and 'dumper.64' programs are designed to be told what to
# set a core content and path to, after which point we use both gcore
# and the kernel to generate a core dump for the file and verify that it
# has what we expect. The verification is done by the secmapper program.
