/*
 * Common types shared between posix_spawn test programs and the spawn_child
 * helper. The helper is exec()d via posix_spawn and reports its process state
 * back to the parent through a pipe using these fixed-size structures.
 *
 * The helper's argv[1] selects the mode:
 *
 *   fds <fd0> <fd1> ...     Report file descriptor state
 *   ids                     Report uid/euid/gid/egid
 *   sched                   Report scheduling policy and priority
 *   sidpgid                 Report session ID and process group ID
 *   sigmask                 Report the current signal mask
 *   sigs <sig0> <sig1> ...  Report signal dispositions
